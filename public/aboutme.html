        Hi, I'm Harry, a Software Developer located in Ontario, Canada.
        Since 2014, I have enjoyed a good challenge whether building the frontend or backend of an application.
        I have been motivated to bring unique software solutions whether automating simple tasks or designing
        for any problem.

        From my experiences, from 2014 to today I have learned vitality of collaboration, the joys of engineering and
        the incredible potential of software.
        <br /><br />
        I visited the realm of programming around 2014. I had little understanding of the capacity which I could take
        these skills until 2015. At the moment in 2015, I discovered the realm of designing and engineering. From seeing
        various websites also using HTML I knew I had a great goal of creating a succesful application.
        <br /><br />
        I made very simple games with HTML and Javascript until I discovered the Unity game engine.
        From various videos of others publishing games by following tutorials, this reinforced me to have a similar
        ambition.
        <br /><br />
        Starting from tutorials, just like I did in my earlier years, I learned to be able to go off the beaten path and
        achieve my own ideas and image of a game. By messing around with the components and learning about the
        individual possibilities of Unity, I began to create my first long term project. In the meantime, I learn from
        tutorials and create various side projects.
        <br /><br />
        As the 3d Tank Game project was built off random experimentation rather than a thorough plan, I did not have a
        long term vision. 2020 brought me the concept of design allowing me to be consistently motivated on a project.
        Along with the usefulness, I discovered the beauty of making mobile application. Since then I've kept committed
        to my projects and have finished a variety of side projects. I've enjoyed helping others and inspire succeed in
        their own software dreams, especially as it gives me a chance to collaborate with them.
        <br /><br />
        Besides making software, you might see me skiing, creating digital art, indulging in history or collaborating in
        my school's clubs.
