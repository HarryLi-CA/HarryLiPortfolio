            Warfare Chaos is a fun tank game where you can control a tank and move around damaging enemies.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was my second large project. I used the Unity game engine which I had some previous experience with.
            I also used C# as it was more popular and eventually Javascript got deprecated for using with Unity.
            The project was created when I started messing around with the code from 3d runner game. I started to think
            about
            rotating the charecter and allowing it to freely move. I eventually learned to constantly read through
            official
            documentation and videos(Udemy and Youtube)
            to figure out if I could use any of their features. I did 3D modeling and creating textures. I put various
            features into the project and was
            even looking at future features. I ran into Unity's new HDRP still in preview(it was very buggy) and
            decided to try it out. This forced me to maintain many features that I had previously created and
            gave me a better understanding of how to make what I coded better. I was planning to work
            with a friend for the project which made me start using source control.
            However, my friend never commited much to the project. This eventually led me to feel less
            enthuastic. Another reason was that the project as a lacked a vision for the future. I learned to create
            minimum
            viable product feature lists in order to keep my motivation in future projects (such as when I created
            projects with Dart).
            <br /><br />
            Also note that the pink object to the right of the screen is a ramp. It doesn't have proper texturing which is
            why it is pink. I never got around to retexturing that specific object after moving the project to HDRP.

        </div>
        <p>
            The first image is in the earlier version of the game which I mistakingly called "beta" and
            the second is from the later version which I also mistakingly called "alpha".
            You can see the second image's HDRP with things like fog and vignette. However,
            many things were corrupted and needed maintance when switching to a pre-release version of Unity.
        </p>

            <img src="../images/warfareChaosEnemyHit.png" alt="Warfare Chaos Hit Enemy" />
        </div>
        <p>
            From the first image you can see the enemy has hit the player causing knockback and having them tumble over.
            From this view you can see the sky texture (which is one of the only components I did not make)
            and more of the HDRP that comes with moving the project to HDRP.
            You can also see the damage to the health bar.
            The second image shows off the particle effects and the circular reload indicator in the bottom left.
            You can also notice the circular minimap moving according to the camera view.
            In the "beta" version, it was a square minimap but I believed that it was more appealing as circular so I
            coded it.
            Note that the method of damaging is hitscan meaning that no real projectile is fired but a ray in order to
            see if there is something in front of the barrel.
            There are 2 particle effects instanciated. 1 is for the barrels smoke and the other is for where the shot
            landed.

            <img src="../images/warfareChaosCameraAdaption.png" alt="Warfare Chaos Camera Adapting" />
        </div>
        <p>
            You can see in the first image that the enemy was destroyed. This was only possible due to the enemy having
            less health.
            The enemy fully tracks the players exact position which allows them to hit the player precisely making it
            hard to destroy.
            In the second image, you can see more of the camera adapting.
            It was done by constantly raycasting to find out how far the wall behind the tank was and poistioning the
            camera accordingly.

        </div>
        <p>
            The first image shows that the turret's barrel has a collider, something that other tank
            games often ignore. It had annoyed me a bit that in most game the barrel can just phase through walls.
            The second image shows the creation of a dialogue manager which was to be integerated for
            a better player experience.

            <img src="../images/warfareChaosMenuScreen.png" alt="Warfare Chaos Main Menu" />
        </div>
        <p>
            The first image shows the messing around of terrain which I did for the early version of the project.
            You can see that I coded the turret to be capable of rugged landscapes while keeping its collider.
            The second image shows the start screen for the game in a hanger.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Unique Fact</b><br />
            As I made this project during my elementary school years, I did not know about trigonmetry.
            This resulted in the player going faster when on a 45 degree angle as it would result in a
            √2 speed compared to normal. <br/>
            Also, you might have noticed the collab button having an error beside it.
            This is because the original method of source control which I used
            for the Unity game engine got deprecated.
