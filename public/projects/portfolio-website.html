        <p>
            For the past few years, I have desired to build a portfolio website in order to document my past experiences
            with software development
            <br />
            <br />
            I didn't want to use a website builder as I wanted to demonstrate my growth as a software developer
            as well as relearn HTML which I had barely used since 2016. 
            At first, I tried out Github Pages to host my website while using their markup. Using their odd markup,
            didn't make me feel accomplished and I wanted a more robust system to host my website so I can have many subfolders
            and pages.
            <br /> <br />
            In the end, I landed upon Firebase Hosting. I had previus experience with the Firebase SDK although not specifically the service.
            It would also allow me to be able to expand the project and potentially create a backend to the website. 
            <br /> <br />
            After picking what to use, I decided upon how the website should look.
            I viewed other websites for companies and portfolios modifying and using different elements to create the design in the top left.

            <img src="../images/harryliportfolionavbarchange.png" alt="Harry Li Portfolio Navbar Transition" />
        </div>
        <p>
            In order to avoid using a background for the navbar, I had to use difference blend mode.
            It provides an incredible effect while preserving readability.<br />
            Eventually, text would come up making the navbar less readable.
            I took this into consideration while designing it in Adobe XD and made it transition into a opaque background when passing the text.
            I also made my name smaller to fit inside the opaque navbar.
